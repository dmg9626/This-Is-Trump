## Motivation

Unity is a very active platform for indie developers, and I wanted to get comfortable working with it by making a simple, fun 2D game. Over the course of development I familiarized myself with the fundamentals of GameObjects/Components and practiced programming game logic, working my way up from simple collision detection, to scripts that play animations when the user presses a button, to data being preserved across scenes. While my code ended up being a little sloppy, it was my first time scripting in Unity and now that I'm comfortable working in that environment, the next game I make will be much better.

and all my friends at Cirque du Twerque for making me love hackathon culture and giving me the drive to make this game. I would never be the developer I am today without you all <3
